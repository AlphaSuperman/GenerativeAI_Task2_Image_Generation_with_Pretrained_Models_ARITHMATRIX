Failure Analysis 


The Stable Diffusion v1.5 model produced generally coherent images, but several artefacts and limitations were observed.  
Common failures included:
- Distorted hands and limbs in humanoid figures (e.g., robot chef).  
- Unrealistic object proportions, especially with animals (e.g., astronaut riding a horse).  
- Blurry or unreadable text in signs or book spines.  
- Overexposed lighting in sunsets and glowing objects.  
- Background objects blending unnaturally with the environment.  

These artefacts are consistent with known limitations of Stable Diffusion v1.5.  
Despite failures, most images matched the semantic content of prompts and were visually appealing.
